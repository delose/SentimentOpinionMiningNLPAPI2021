Two years ago, each Ada was worth $0.08554, so that $10,000 would have bought you 116,904 Ada. At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap puts the price of Ada at $1.61, so 116,904 Ada would be worth $188,216. That's an increase of over 1,700% and it makes Cardano the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization right now. What is Cardano? Cardano is a third-generation cryptocurrency that aims to solve some of the scalability and sustainability issues faced by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).",
